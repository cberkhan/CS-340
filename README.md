How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing a modular approach. This allows for the separation of functions in the program and for future updates and adjustments. I also try to create programs that are commented on to explain the function of each module. Creating my program allowed me to seamlessly utilize my CRUD python module for both project one and project two without any issues. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approached this project by breaking each task and requirement down into smaller steps. This approach allowed me to fully understand what the project needed to meet the requirements of the client and how it functioned. For example, the CRUD Python module was broken down into two different assignments and it made creating a functional program extremely easy. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists create programs that solve the client's problem. In this project, Grazioso Salvare needed a solution to review multiple animal sheltersâ€™ information and a way to sort/filter through that information to rescue animals. This kind of work allows a company to achieve their goals and for this particular project, save the lives of many animals.
